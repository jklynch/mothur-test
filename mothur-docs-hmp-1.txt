I have had some memory problems imeadiately following running
this command.  I replaced the execute function in classify.svm
with the new one from classify.rf - that seems to have solved
the problem with -O0, -O1 for just the svm code, and ???
The memory problems seem to be solved by doing a make clean and
recompiling everything.  It is probably not necessary to recompile
every file but it works.

classify.svm(shared=../data/Stool.0.03.subsample.0.03.filter.shared,design=../data/Stool.0.03.subsample.0.03.filter.mix.design)

classify.svm(mode=classify,kernel=polynomial,shared=../data/Stool.0.03.subsample.0.03.filter.shared,design=../data/Stool.0.03.subsample.0.03.filter.mix.design)
